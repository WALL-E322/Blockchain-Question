Whatâ€™s modifier? (Declare a modifier that takes two integer parameters called 
level and zombieId.
Check if Zombies[_zombieId].level is greater or equal to _level.


    Modifiers usually check some conditions inside them. We can attach the modifier's name at the end of a function (or multiple functions) definition
    to change that function's behavior.
    The code inside the modifiers is executed first (usually contains a require statement).  
   
    modifier CheckLevel(uint _level, uint _zombieId){
        require(Zombies[_zombieId].level >= _level);
        _;
    }
