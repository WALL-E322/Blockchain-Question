Whatâ€™s the difference between Send and Call in Solidity?
  We use Call() when we want to read a data from our contract and it doesn't cost us any money.
  We use Send() when we want to write something in our contract (i.e: giving or changing a value for a variable) and in order to do that we have to pay a transaction fee.
