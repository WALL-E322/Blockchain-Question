What’s EVM? Would you mind differing the NON-EVM and EVMs?


  The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the core of the Ethereum network. It is a computation engine which acts like a decentralized computer executing and deploying
smart contract. EVM to Ethereum is like a CPU to a computer. For this computations, you need to pay a fee in ETH called gas. EVM is "quasi-Turing complete" which means
it is Turing complete as long as there is gas to run a smart contract.(when somethins is Turing complete, it could be used to solve any computation problem.)

  EVM-compatible public chains for developers creates a code execution environment similar to the EVM.
They can quickly acquire customers and grow in the early stages with the benefits of Ethereum. They also have some advantages For users such as lower gas fees,
faster settlement, and the same address format as Ethereum, making the environment more user-friendly. However, they have to compete with
many other chains in the Ethereum ecosystem.

  Non-EVM Can create more differentiated and innovative applications and they have the opportunities to break down ecosystem barriers and build a new one. On the other hand,
They have high developer costs and some difficulties migrating projects and users from other chains.
They are more likely to grow into categories where new ideas emerge like NFT and GameFi.

  Currently, most of the top 10 chains are compatible with the EVM, and even Non-EVM chains like Polkadot and Solana are making EVM-compatible solutions or can
already operate with Ethereum’s account system (Neon Labs deployed EVM on Solana and Moonbeam launch brings EVM interoperability closer to the Polkadot network)
