Declare a modifier called onlyOwner which throws if called by any account other 
than the owner.


    address contractOwner;
    
    constructor() { //constructor code is executed once when a contract is created and it is used to initialize contract state.
    
        contractOwner = msg.sender; //assign the address of the person who deploys the contract to contractOwner because the constructor 
        
    }

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(contractOwner == msg.sender, "Caller is not the owner"); //check if the person who uses the function has the same address with the person who owns the contract
        _;
    }
    
     function sth() public onlyOwner{ // if the condition in the require statement inside the modifier, returns false then the function is not executed
        uint a = 6;
        return a + 10 ;
    }
