  Audius is a brand-new streaming platform build for all musicians. Artists can build a fanbase and publish their work all over the word without the necessity of any other platform or signing to a label. With Audius there is no need to a third-party for streaming music so artists can directly interact with their fans. They also can get up to 90% of their revenue in the form of AUDIO token that is much higher than 12% which is in traditional system. Everyone can contribute to the audius platform as 
the consensus model is POS, based on the amount of AUDIO token they have. Another cool feature of this platform is that unlike traditional system which rewards artist 
based on number of views, in audius atrist get paid based on their activity meaning more interactions with fans brings in more money on the table. This feature 
can be useful to ignore the fake views in trasitional system being an important factor for payments.
  As the whitepapre says there is a "content ledger" that is the source of truth for all data accessible within the audius protocol giving us the full transparency. But 
there is a issue in this platform. Because of Audius decentralized nature, there is no copyright protection, although the protocol is working on an arbitration system
that will be overlooked by the community.
  All in all, in my opinion audius protocol is a good place to invest money on and take a part of ones portfolio since the music industry is very popular all around
the world and its combination with blockchain technology comes in with numerous benefits. Furthermore, the artists would eventually use these kind of platforms as they can earn much more money meanwhile dealing less with companies, labels, contracts and paper works.
