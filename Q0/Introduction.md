My name is Omid Omidian. I'm 23 years old and I've studied computer engineering at the University of Tehran. I'm currently located in Tehran But I was born and 
raised in a town called Ferdows in Khorasan Jonoobi. I've always been a language enthusiast and my skills in English language are at a good level I believe.
I also know a bit french. Last year as we had a crypto hype all around th world, I got curious and searched about bitcoin and got familiar with blockchain.
The immutability, clarity and most importantly the decentralization of that made me so eager to know more about it. Now I'm really looking forward to have the chance
to learn more and more about blockchain practically as I already know some of the theories. My career goal is to become a blockchain developer and
help to expand this technology through out the world and  be a part of this family.
