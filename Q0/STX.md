  Stacks is a layer-1 blockchain solution that is designed to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) to Bitcoin (BTC). These smart contracts are
brought to Bitcoin without changing any of the features that make it so powerful including its security and stability. It's connecting directly with the Bitcoin blockchain through its proof-of-transfer(PoX) consensus mechanism, which has miners pay in BTC to mint new Stacks (STX) tokens. Moreover, STX token holders can also stack(not stake) their tokens to earn Bitcoin as a reward. PoX helps us deliver ownership in the digital world and with digital ownership comes freedom and help us connect two independet blockchains (bitcoin and stacks) together. The transactions are executed in stacks blockchain and are approved in the bitcoin blockchain helping us with the scalibilty of the bitcoin blockchain.

 Stacks also introduces a new smart contract programming language known as Clarity, designed to be both secure and easy to build.

  Stacks in this network are similar to stakers in POS blockchains as they can participate in consensus and get rewarded with BTC. They also can act like a nod and get 
all the information gathered in the blockchain.

  In my opinion, this project is valuable and can improve more and more in future. The tokenomics in the whitepaper are also distributed adequately and it can take 
a pretty good part of ones portfolio as there is various ways to get rewarded in this protocol. More importantly, these rewards are paid in BTC which is the most 
important and consistent currency so far.
