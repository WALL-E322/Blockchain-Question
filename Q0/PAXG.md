  PAX Gold is a digital asset backed by gold where one token represents one fine troy ounce of a London Good Delivery gold bar, stored in professional vaults in London.
Anyone who owns PAX Gold owns the underlying gold which is held under the custody of Paxos Trust Company. The value of PAX Gold therefore also tracks with
the real-time market price of gold. PAX Gold is built as an Ethereum-based token following the ERC-20 protocol, making it compatible with all Ethereum wallets
that accept ERC-20 tokens.

  Paxos is a state-chartered trust company regulated by the New York State Departmentof Financial Services (NYDFS) and must uphold the highest standards of customer asset
protection. Additionally, the NYDFS has approved and regulates PAXG.

  The main goal behind Pax Gold is to make gold more tradable, as the physical commodity is not easily divisible or flexible in terms of transport.
  
  So in my opinion, people won't get involve in this project. Gold is a traditional commodity for investment and keep the money
safe against the inflation. I don't think convincing this people to give up on their traditional way and try this digital asset needs quite a time. Also small invester 
usually don't have the issue to own physical gold as they don't own a lot of it. So as much I like this creative idea to keep gold in the form of digital asset, I don't
put a lot of money on this project.
