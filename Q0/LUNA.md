  Terra is a public blockchain deploying a suite of algorithmic decentralized stablecoins. As their solid whitepaper indicates this protocol is trying to bring 
stablecoins in daily use and most importantly be decentralized. They have two coins, Terra and LUNA: Different forms of terra ( terraUSD, terraKRW and etc) have
stable price and LUNA price can grow. The creative idea behind this project is that people get rewarded to keep the price of this stablecoins not fluctuate. 
The foundation also claimed to back their stablecoins with BTC and bought a huge amount of BTC in order to do that. But as you may have noticed, they recently transferredall their BTC out of their wallet, and dump it on the market. So now they are known as evil market maker and as a result they exprienced a 95% drop in price in just 7 days going from 87$ to only just 5$.

  In my opinion this project has lost all the reputation and people would no longer trust them. So even if one may consider this price of luna as a opportunity to buy, I strongly refuse to put any kind of investment in this project as It failed in its mission.
