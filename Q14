Investigate the differences using Golang and Solidity languages.
In your option, which one is better and more convenient? could you explain your 
reason?

  Solidity is an object-oriented and statically-typed programming language that was designed to allow developers to create smart contracts.It is designed based on
existing programming languages and it's very similar to  JavaScript so it has similar structures.Solidity has a large, accessible community. Because Solidity was the
first smart contract programming language and was developed solely for smart contract programming on the Ethereum network.
  The only usage of solidity is on Ethereum ecosystem which is one of the most significant parts of blockchain development now.

  Golang is an open-source programming language that was developed by Google. It is loosely based on the syntax of the C programming language. It is is used for
implementing the blockchain node software itself (basically the platform on top of which Solidity runs).


RESULT => This two programming languages are both fairly new and the community is not big yet but both of them take care of blockchain developement.
  I personnaly think that Golang is better because it has the advantages of dynamic languages like python with performance and security advantage of the compiled language
like C. Golang has a safe memory and garbage collection. It also has fast compilation time. Since Golang is optimized for multi-core CPU architecture,
it's extremely practical for highly parallel and concurrent software such as blockchain networks.
