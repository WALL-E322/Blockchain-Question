How can we make a condition in solidity using required? (Make an example)

  The condition inside the require must return true so the next lines of code get executed 
  
  //we assume the the owner variable is the address of the person who deploys the contract
  function add(uint num1, uint num2) public {
    uint result;
    require(msg.sender == owner,"Only the contract owner can use this function!! ");// if the condition in the require returns false, the second parameter pops up 
    result num1 + num2;
    return result;
  }
