Whatâ€™s the difference between ERC20 and ERC721?

   ERC20 serves as a standard protocol for the Ethereum blockchain and enables users to share, exchanging or transfer tokens.
The standard content in ERC-20 token include components such as Token Name, Symbol, Decimal, totalSupply,
balanceOf, transfer, transferFrom, Allowance, and approve. The first three components, are optional entities in ERC20 tokens
However, the other six components are mandatory for the tokens following ERC-20 standard.
   ERC-20 tokens are Fungible tokens meaning they represent a value, like a currency note. They are interchangeable and not unique.
 Most of the tokens that we see on exchanges today are fungible tokens on Ethereum blockchain. Also, these tokens are divisible.
 This means you can give 0.1 of your token to someone else.
 
   ERC-721 tokens are also referred to as NFTs. ERC-721 token standards help developers in tokenizing the ownership of any type of arbitrary data.
 In comparison to ERC20, ERC721 simplifies ownership: a participant either completely owns or does not fully own an asset.
    ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible meaning they represent a unique asset, like a certificate of ownership for a painting.
 These tokens are not interchangeable and although they hold value, that value is not the same as any other token of the same type.
 ERC-721 tokens are non-divisible which means you cannot give half of your token to someone.
