Could we inherit from more than one contract? (If itâ€™s possible How?)
  Yes it is possible. We just need to separate them by comma 
  for example if contract A is going to inherit from contract B and contract C, we do it as follows:
    contract A is B, C {
    ...
    }
    
  another scenario is possible to. If contract B inherit from contract C then contract A inherit from contract B, basically contract A in inherited from B and C
    contract B is C{}
    contract A is B{} //contract A has access to functions and variables to B and C contracts
